# DataStructuresReview
 
## Project Description

This Project is designed to demonstrate the various data structures that exist in Java through implementing them. Those include ArrayList and LinkedList. For the LinkedList class, the implementation that will be followed is the DoublyLinkedList class as per what is followed in standard Java.

## Files

### AbstractCollection<E>, AbstractList<E>, AbstractSequentialList<E>
    These are three files that extend each other, i.e., AbstractList<E> extends AbstractCollection<E> and AbstractSequentialList<E> extends AbstractList<E>
